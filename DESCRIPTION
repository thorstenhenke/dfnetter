Description: Researchers often store their collected network data in a tabular data format. 
    However, for most of the network packaages available for the R statistics suite a 
    tabular data format is not suitable and the data need to be transoformed into more 
    common data structures like edge lists, adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, etc. Since
    this is a repetiitve task thats needs to be performed by many ressearchers, over
    and over again procedures are provided taht simplify this task.
