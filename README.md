# dfnetter

Researchers often store their collected network data in a tabular data format. However, for most of the network packaages available for the R statistics suite a tabular data format is not suitable and the data need to be transoformed into more common data structures like edge lists, adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, etc. Since this is a repetiitve task thats needs to be performed by many ressearchers, over and over again procedures are provided that simplify this task.
